# CoinPairing
TPS Coursework 2018

There are n coins placed in a row. The goal is to form n/2 pairs of them by a sequence of moves. On each move a single coin can jump right or left over two coins adjacent to it (i.e., over either two single coins or one previously formed pair), to land on the next single coin; no triples are allowed. Any empty space between adjacent coins is ignored. Devise an algorithm that solves the puzzle in the minimum number of moves for such ns.
